##Getting to MVP: Creating and deploying a full-stack application with React and Relay

Hello! Welcome! My name is Carl Peaslee and in this course we are going to plan, configure, create, and finally deploy a scalable full-stack React and Relay application –– complete with a database and authentication.

React is a popular new javascript framework, created by Facebook, that offers a number of developer friendly tools which facilitate quick and efficient application development. React is a widely used and broadly supported framework –– which means you'll have access to lots of pre-built components and features –– and if you ever have difficulty, you can draw upon a large community of experts on stackoverflow and github for guidance. 

This course is intended for people who have a good familiarity with many of the elements of full-stack JavaScript web development and want to create their own web application and then deploy it out onto the real live internet.

I know it can be difficult sometimes to figure out how to integrate all those different technologies and then more difficult still to get them working together in a production environment which is why I'm going to show you how to combine all of the different tools, components, and libraries from start to finish. 

We're going to be building a site where users can play simple games (like TicTacToe) against mystery opponents who may or may not be a machine pretending to be human.

Regardless of whether or not you are working on a startup with a short runway or a side-project you’d just like to see get off the ground, this application will allow you to learn and practice all the neccesary skills –– like laying out a UX roadmap, building the foundation of our application, creating individual components, implementing authentication, and connecting our application to a remote database.  

The mindset for this course is ‘Geting to MVP’. MVP is a term startups and developers will often use that stands for Minimum Viable Product –– that is, the simplest functioning version of our intended application –– but which still demonstrates our larger goals and ideas.
