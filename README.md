##Creating Our Profile Page

[Live on Heroku](https://tictacturing-02-08.herokuapp.com/)

In this video we’re going to have a whole lot less loops and a lot more styling. We're going to leave our TicTacToe game alone for now and focus on our profile. 

We’ve got our TicTacToe game now and the last thing on our wireframe is to build a profile view.

The first thing I’m going to do is declare some default props so I can imagine what the data coming into my site will look like...

Then I’m going to start creating styled-components that will make up the bulk of my view. I can pass a prop here for my name –– likely a lot of these variables will change but this is fine for now.

And as I’m doing this I’m going to style things...

And finally, I can see that I’m going to need a function that will return an array of components that will make up the list of game records we need to put here.

So I’ll write this...

And we test things out and great.
