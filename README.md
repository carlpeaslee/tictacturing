##Overview of the App


In the first video for this class I gave you a short preview of the application we are going to be building.

I mentioned that I wanted to do something with machine learning so I came up with an idea for a site where users could login and play simple games (like TicTacToe) against a mystery opponent who may or may not be a machine pretending to be a human.

But now let’s take a step back, way back to the brainstorming and planning phase.

Remember our mindset for this course is Getting to MVP –– Minimum Viable Product –- that means we need to keep our eyes on the prize and pair away unnecessary complexity from our application.

Watch out for feature creep! While we are planning our app, we’re going to make sure we focus on our application’s core functionality and the potential complexity of any additional feature we might want to add.

Get a really good idea but think it might be a bit tricky to implement? Write it down, hopefully you’ll get to it in a future version.

Here, for instance, are some of the features we are gong to implement and some of the features that I want to add but I’m afraid I’m going to have to save for later.

To guide the first state of our development, we’re going to create two important sets of documents. These will be our ‘User Stories’ and our ‘Wireframes’.

Our user stories are intended to aid development by providing us with a linear, narrative-style description of a hypothetical user's action as they utilize our application.

If you haven't done wire-framing before, don't be afraid to use a pen and paper. But if you're looking for a slick tool, there are a bunch of them. Here are a few:
