Hello! Welcome! My name is Carl Peaslee and in this course we are going to plan, configure, create, and finally deploy a scalable full-stack React and Relay application –– complete with a database and authentication.

This course is intended for people who have a good familiarity with many of the elements of full-stack JavaScript web development and want to create their own web application and then deploy it out onto the real live internet.

I know it can be difficult sometimes to figure out how to integrate all those different technologies and then more difficult still to get them working together in a production environment.

The mindset for this course is ‘Geting to MVP’. MVP is a term startups and developers will often use that stands for Minimum Viable Product –– that is, the simplest functioning version of our intended application –– but which still demonstrates our larger goals and ideas.

Regardless of whether or not you are working on a startup with a short runway or a side-project you’d just like to see get off the ground, it’s often beneficial to the application development process to quickly get to MVP so that you can begin the cycle of iteration and improvement.

As an example project for this course, we are going to create the MVP for a hobby project I’ve been working on called TicTacTuring (named, of course, after the machine learning pioneer [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing)).

Let’s take a look at what you’re going to be building.

I’ve always wanted to use machine learning in a project but I haven’t yet had a reason to implement it. My idea was to make a site where users could create an account and then play simple games (like TicTacToe) against mystery opponents who may or may not be machines pretending to be human.

After a user finished playing, the second part of the game would be to try and guess whether or not their opponent was a human or a robot.

I also wanted users to be able to maintain a profile, track their game records, and maybe someday compete to climb a scoreboard which would track the best robot hunters.
