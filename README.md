##Creating a Git Repository


Anytime I start on a project, I make sure to set up my version control right away.

In this course we are going to be using git and the free remote version control management site GitHub. Other options would be BitBucket. And I know that Nuclide actually has some nice integrations with Mercurial.

In my project directory I’m going to initialize my git repository:

```bash
git init
```

and then I’m going to add everything in my project folder to my repository

```bash
git add .
```

and then commit those changes

```bash
git commit -m ‘first commit’
```

Now I’m going to login to my GitHub account and create a new repository... name it... and copy paste the remote repository url

And add it to my account from the command line

And push all my files up to my remote repository.
